# LandscapeGenerator
This project was created as a project for Interaction Engineering at the FH Augsburg.
The Landscape Generator is a tool to create levels or landscapes randomly by rolling dice or by placing them one by one. The dice get recorded by a webcam and a python program then reads the pips on the top side of the dice. Every number of pips is assigned to a model of a speciÔ¨Åed set. The position and the model get transferred to the a website, which shows the scenery in 3D. The user can move the camera, look at the creation and adjust the scene by moving the dice by hand.
